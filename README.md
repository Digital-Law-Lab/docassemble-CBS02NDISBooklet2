# CBS02NDISBooklet2

This application is designed to aid CBS clients who have intellectual disabilities to complete *Booklet 2* for their NDIS planning meeting. 

Preparing for a planning meeting can be an overwhelming and difficult process. It is important to be adequately prepared for a planning meeting as it plays a large role in determing how much financial support an individual will be granted as part of their plan. 

This application has been designed to make the process easier and more accessible. CBS clients are encouraged to answer questions honestly and in a manner that will best serve the purpose of the planning meeting. It has been designed with AAT decisions and NDIS expections in mind in order to best prepare CBS clients to get the most out of their meeting.
