  Hint: When thinking of a goal try to make sure it is clear (specific) and reachable. Use the SMART goal guide to see whether you need to adjust your goals.  Make sure your goal is: 
  
  * Specific (simple, sensible, significant). This means that it is clear, and you    know why you want to reach that goal;
  * Measurable (meaningful, motivating). This means you should be able to know       when your goal is achieved. To do this you need to answer questions such as; how   much?;
  * Achievable (agreed, attainable). This means the goal is something that you can   reach and are able to do;
  * Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based). This means that   the goal is something that can be added into your life without causing any         problems; and
  * Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-           sensitive). You need to be able to set a time limit for when this goal should be   reached e.g. by next Monday.
