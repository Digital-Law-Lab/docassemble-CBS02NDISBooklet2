question: Write 2 short term goals that you would like to achieve

help: |
  When thinking of a goal try to make sure it is clear and possible to do. Use the SMART goal guide to see whether you need to adjust your goals.  Make sure your goal is: 
  
  * Specific (simple, sensible, significant). This means that it is clear, and you    know why you want to reach that goal;
  * Measurable (meaningful, motivating). This means you would be able to know       when your goal is achieved. To do this you need to answer questions such as; how   much? And, in how much time?  For example: writing that you want to be able to run is not measurable, you need to know how many far you would like to run and in what time frame; 
  * Achievable (agreed, attainable). This means the goal is something that you can   reach and are able to do with some effort or practise;
  * Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based). This means that   the goal is something that can be added into your life without causing any         problems; and
  * Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-           sensitive). You need to be able to set a time limit for when this goal should be   reached e.g. by next Monday.

question: Write 2 long term goals that you would like to achieve
Subquestion: |
   A long term goal is something you would like to reach in a few years. It is important to write down the steps that it would take for you to reach these goals. If you think you would need help to reach these goals, write about that too.  
fields:
  - Goal 1: long_goals1
    input type: area 
    default: In the next 2-3 years, I want to move out of home, maybe with a friend. To do this I would need to save money, practise cooking and showering on my own and practise catching public transport. 
  - Goal 2: long_goals2
    input type: area
    default: Get a job working at the library in 2-3 years so that I can pay my own bills. To do this I would need to practise talking to strangers. I would need to write a resume and get a friend to help me. I would also have to practise catching public transport.
